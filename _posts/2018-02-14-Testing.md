title: This is the second blog post
---

This is a second test post. Here is a synopsis. When using `join` or `inner join`, the `on` condition is optional. This is different from the ANSI standard and different from almost any other database. The effect is a `cross join`. Similarly, you can use an `on` clause with `cross join`, which also differs from standard SQL.

A cross join creates a Cartesian product -- that is, every possible combination of 1 row from the first table and 1 row from the second. The cross join for a table with three rows ('a', 'b', and 'c') and a table with four rows (say 1, 2, 3, 4) would have 12 rows.

```python
for i in range(1,10):
    print i
print 'hello world!'
```
